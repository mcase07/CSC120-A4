Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
I'm still not totally sure of why you would need public/private objects, classes, etc. but I feel like it makes sense in theory. I'm still having a hard time referencing object and lists from other classes. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think for an assignment with this many files, it's key to test as you go, and not leave it all to the end. It's easy also to get confused about what each thing is doing so making sure to document everything is important too.
